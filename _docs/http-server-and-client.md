# Basic concepts
The router is one of the core concepts of Firefly HTTP server. It maintains zero or more Routes.

A router takes an HTTP request and finds the first matching route for that request, and passes the request to that route.

The route can have a handler associated with it, which then receives the request. You then do something with the request, and then, either end it or pass it to the next matching handler.

Hereâ€™s a simple router example:
```java
public class HelloHTTPServerAndClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Phaser phaser = new Phaser(3);

        HTTP2ServerBuilder httpServer = $.httpServer();
        httpServer.router().get("/").handler(ctx -> ctx.write("hello world! ").next())
                  .router().get("/").handler(ctx -> ctx.end("end message"))
                  .listen("localhost", 8080);

        $.httpClient().get("http://localhost:8080/").submit()
         .thenAccept(res -> System.out.println(res.getStringBody()))
         .thenAccept(res -> phaser.arrive());

        phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
        httpServer.stop();
        $.httpClient().stop();
    }
}
```

It basically does the same thing as the HTTP server hello world example from the previous section,
but this time using two routers handle GET method and path '/'.

**Route order:**  
By default routes are matched in the order they are added to the router.
When a request arrives the router will step through each route and check if it matches, if it matches then the handler for that route will be called.

**Calling the next handler:**  
If the handler subsequently calls **ctx.next()** the handler for the next matching route (if any) will be called. And so on.

In the above example the response will contain:
```
hello world! end message
```
