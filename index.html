			Firefly is a asynchronous web framework which
			bases on intuitive design that enables <strong>QUICK and EASY</strong> development of network applications,
			such as web site, protocol servers, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you already worked with some web applications, such as spring framework, you will feel right at home.
			Firefly uses some same concepts and naming schemes.
			Even if you’re from a different background, you’ll get the hang of it quickly,
			because everything is designed to be a intuitive and easy to use as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
			Quick and easy doesn't mean it has the performance issue or it's not maintainable.
			Actually, Firefly’s performance is better than the others.
			It exposes the hardware’s full potential and uses some technologies of the state of the art to achieve high throughput.
			In short: <strong>It’s FAST.</strong>

			Firefly has a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture, that is a flexible and extensible model. 
			Each component can be used independently, which has been designed carefully
			with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of web frameworks.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a result, Firefly has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
